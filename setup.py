einguteswerkzeug - a creative tool for generative artworks
==========================================================

einguteswerkzeug (`egw`) is a **cli-tool for creating minimalistic visual artworks** in
printing quality. it can also simply be used only for **giving your photos a fairly
well & individual vintage polaroid style** by placing an image
into a Polaroid-like frame and optionally put a title / description or meta infos
out of EXIF-data on the bottom. The default font mimics scribbled handwriting
but any (ttf-)font which suits your taste is supported. The tool offers basic
features like auto-scaling up-/downwards and/or cropping, using any (ttf-)font,
supports high-res output and gets it's job done well.

einguteswerkzeug provides some phonky **filters and generative art capabilities**
mostly based on wonderfull open-source-projects and inspiring blog-articles
around (see credits & thanks). in short the software provides:

* generative-art-"generators" which are fun to play with
* chainable filters (`--filter f1,f2,...,fN`)
* reading & processing EXIF-data
* lightweight plugin-framework - makes it simple to use (and write) additional filters & generators
* vintage polaroid style supporting (high-res) templates
* supports your favorite (truetype-)font
* `--help`-option :) + usage-examples as shellscripts

The author's main usecase for einguteswerkzeug is doing minimalistic artworks in
printing quality with it.

To see if it could be usefull for your needs take a look at the project's
github-repo and check out the `examples`_

einguteswerkzeug is actively maintained & developed (2019).

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
