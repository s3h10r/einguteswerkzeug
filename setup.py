einguteswerkzeug - vintage polaroid style + generative art
==========================================================

einguteswerkzeug is a command-line-tool & python-library for placing an image
into a Polaroid-like frame and optionally put a title / description or meta infos
out of EXIF-data on the bottom. The default font mimics scribbled handwriting
but any (ttf-)font which suits your taste is supported. The tool offers basic
features like auto-scaling up-/downwards and/or cropping, using any (ttf-)font,
supports high-res output and gets it's job done well.

Starting as a script for making high-res contactsheets which make the beholder's
eyes not bleed recently einguteswerkzeug gets phonky by turning into an artist's tool:

* generative-art-"generators" which are fun to play with
* chainable filters (`--filter f1,f2,...,fN`)
* reading EXIF-data
* lightweight plugin-framework - makes it simple to use (and write) additional filters & generators
* support for templates
* `--help`-option :)

The author's main usecase for einguteswerkzeug is doing minimalistic artworks in
printing quality with it - and learning and mixing fun to use technologies
full-stack around it (raspi, webapis, flutter). :D

To see if it could be usefull for your needs take a look at the project's
github-repo and check out the `examples`_

einguteswerkzeug is actively maintained & developed (2019).

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!

Please feel free to send a pull-request and use the `issue tracker <https://github.com/s3h10r/einguteswerkzeug/issues>`_.

Have fun!
